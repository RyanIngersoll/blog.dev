				<u><h1 id="left">Full Stack Web Developer and Financial Engineer</h1></u>
				<h4 id="left">I am the unique double threat of a full-stack, web developer coupled with the savvy of a veteran derivatives trader of the last two decades. The value I deliver lies in my ability to <span>develop and code proprietary quantitative strategies</span> as well as bridge the communication gaps which occur between trading desks and application developers for investment banks, prop firms or hedge funds.</h4><br>

				<h4 id="left">I am currently enrolled in <span>Codeup's</span> immersive 12-week Web Developer/Programming bootcamp for working professionals (Graduation Nov. 5th 2014). This is an intense program to develop skills with the LAMP +J stack: Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP and client-side JavaScript using the Laravel framework and jQuery. The curriculum goes way beyond the parameters of traditional computer science degrees through <span>interaction with the local tech community</span> to create new business web applications via the capstone project. In this way, Codeup graduates become seasoned "plug and play" problem solvers who bring <span>value added solutions to solve company specific issues.</span></h4><br><br>

				<u><h1 id="left">Achievements and Leadership</h1></u><br>

				<h4 id="left">As the lead investment and technology analyst for SRI Diversified Capital, I have consulted on multiple drilling projects within the Eagle Ford Shale development. One of my primary responsibilities is to <span>create unique risk management solutions for the energy sector.</span> This eventually led to an extension of profit opportunities of insurance beyond gap coverage of liabilities. Specifically I was able to draw on my <span>expertise in risk transfer and distribution</span> through the futures markets to <span>engineer the framework of a new exchange traded derivatives platform</span> for the reinsurance industry known as the <span>ILF index.</span></h4><br>

				<h4 id="left">Having traded across the entire spectrum of the capital markets, IMHO The Russell 2000 Index futures (symbol #TF) offer the best combination of volatility, liquidity and low trading costs available. It is no coincidence then my primary strategy is a <span>long/short option strategy</span> focused around monthly expiration cycles of the #TF front month contract. To a lesser extent, I deployed capital around the <span>WTI Crude futures</span> (symbol CL). This was a volatility based system taking its entry and exits from my <span>proprietary blend of the S&P VIX and the crude oil VIX.</span> When the opportunities were right, I took less frequent positions against <span>wheat, corn, soybeans, copper, 10 year Treasuries, S&P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones.</span> My option strategies combined <span>put and call spreads, butterflies, strip, strap, strangles, and calendar spreads.</span> Options consistently gave added flexibility to my directional trading as well as valuable risk management to my overall core positions. </h4><br>

				<h4 id="left"><span>Chosen by Goldman Sachs</span> for the Summer Analyst Program was the direct result of graduating from Kent State’s prestigious master’s program in Financial Engineering.  My primary team assignments were to <span>manage risk</span> through bundling single name issuances of corporate debt within the Bank’s inventory for modeling prices of offsetting CDS positions <span>critical to the structured product trading desk.</span></h4><br>

				<h4 id="left">The <span>opportunity to open a new regional branch</span> of Paulson Investment Co in San Antonio, TX was a rare chance for a young professional to gain valuable management experience.  I obtained the <span>Series 7, 24 and 63</span> licenses which gave me authority to <span>supervise the growth and compliance</span> of over 300 new accounts, with assets under management of over $50 million.</h4><br>

			<div class="jumbotron1">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo1">Part I</h1>
				<h1 id="jumbo2">"HOW IT ALL STARTED"</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron2">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo21">As far back as I can remember, I knew I was going to be a TRADER.</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="jumbotron2b">
				<h1 id="jumbo22">As I grew up, "WALL STREET" was my favorite movie and "Gordon Gekko" had become a cultural icon.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron3">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo31"></h1>
				<h1 id="jumbo32">But in order to become GEKKO, first I had to be BUD FOX. So after college I became a stock broker at a small firm in Texas.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron4">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo41">Over the next seven years I PAID MY DUES and worked my way closer to the GOAL.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron4b">

				<h1 id="jumbo42">But the INTERNET revolution of the 90's had changed the investment industry and I would have to ADAPT in order to survive.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron5">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo51">So in 2002, I went to graduate school and received both an MBA and an MS in Financial Engineering.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron5b">

				<h1 id="jumbo52">Then in 2006, I was CHOSEN among my peers to intern at Goldman Sachs in NYC. I had finally arrived on Wall Street.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron6">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo61">"If you can make it in NY, you can make it anywhere."</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron6b">
				<h1 id="jumbo62">But Chicago is "my kind of town" and because it is THE CENTER of the commodity trading world, it was only a matter of time before I made it my HOME.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron7">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo71">Part II</h1>
				<h1 id="jumbo72">"THE TRADER"</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron8">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo81">In 2006, I started "Ingersoll Investment Co." A commodity futures trading firm in Chicago.</h1>
			</div>
				
			<div class="jumbotron8b">
				<h1 id="jumbo82">Trading VOLATILITY was my specialty.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron9">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo91">By 2007, I was one of the LARGEST volume traders in Russell 2000 emini options on futures. Put and call spreads, straddles and strangles were my main weapons.</h1>
				<h2 id="jumbo92"></h2>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron10">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo101">But by 2012, trading was changing again as "dark pools" and "co-location" were the new buzz-words on both Wall Street and the pits of Chicago.</h1>

			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron10b">

				<h1 id="jumbo102">To stay relevant in the new world of  HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING, I would have to become a programmer.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron12">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo121">And then most important window of my career flew WIDE OPEN.</h1>
				<h2 id="jumbo122"></h2>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron13">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo131">Part III</h1>
				<h1 id="jumbo132">"THE CODEUP EXPERIENCE"</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron14">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo141">TIMING can be everything and just when I needed it the most, the Codeup bootcamp for web developers was BORN.</h1>
				<h2 id="jumbo142"></h2>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron15">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo151">Codeup turns non-tech professionals into full-stack web development programmers.</h1>
				<h2 id="jumbo152"></h2>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron17">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo171">As a GRADUATE of Codeup, I now have the right tools to return to the business I love.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron19">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo191">I am an object oriented programmer,  trained in the LAMP+J stack with the PHP/Laravel MVC framework.</h1>

			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron19b">
				<h1 id="jumbo192">But more importantly, I have learned how to LEARN code. Which means I can ADAPT QUICKLY to the unique frameworks of various developer shops.</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="jumbotron20">
            
				<h1 id="jumbo201">When you HIRE ME, your getting a solutions oriented programmer with 20 years of trading experience and NEVER stops pushing himself to LEARN, ADAPT and OVERCOME.</h1>
